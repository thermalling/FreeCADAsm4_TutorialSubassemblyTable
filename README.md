Table Assembly Tutorial
============
A very simple subassembly task using the FreeCAD Assembly 4 Workbench
----------

Our table has just three component types:

1. table top
1. leg
1. foot

We will make a sub-assembly from the leg and the foot, then add four of these to the table top.

Set up the files:
==================
Create the following five files, saving them in the same directory for convenience:

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/Files.png)

---------------------
Create the table top:
=======================

Switch to the TableTop tab at the bottom of your window: ![](TableSubassyScreenshots/TabTableTop.png)

Choose the Assembly 4 workbench ![](TableSubassyScreenshots/Assy4Workbench.png)  and create a new Body ![](TableSubassyScreenshots/NewBody.png) leaving the default name "Body".

Expanding our model tree, it now looks like this:

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/TreeTable.png)

Right-click on the Body in the tree:

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/ActiveBody.png)
and select "Toggle active body".
This will change you out of the **Assembly 4** workbench to the **Part Design** workbench. ![](TableSubassyScreenshots/WorkbenchPartDesign.png)

Click on the New Sketch button: ![](TableSubassyScreenshots/NewSketch.png).  Select "XY_Plane001 (Base Plane)" from the dialog and hit OK.

Create the following sketch of approximately 600mm x 400mm small table top:

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/SketchTableTop.png)

Constrain the corners to the centre with a symmetry constraint.  (Select the two corners, then the origin, and hit the 's' key).

Hit ESC or OK and pad the selected sketch ![](TableSubassyScreenshots/PadSketch.png) by 20mm, then zoom out to see your part:

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/TableTopComplete.png)

Save the *TableTop* file.

--------------------------
Create the leg
=================

Follow the same procedure as above to create the table leg, with sketch dimensions of 40x40mm and pad height of 300mm.

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/SketchLeg.png)

As per the table, constrain the corners to the centre with a symmetry constraint.  (Select the two corners, then the origin, and hit the 's' key). This will allow us to use the default Local Co-ordinate System to attach the foot to the centre of the leg later.

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/LegComplete.png)

Our leg model tree should now look like this:

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/TreeLeg.png)

Save the *Leg* file.

----------------------

Create the foot:
===================

Repeat the procedure again, this time creating a circular sketch with a 60mm diameter:

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/SketchFoot.png)

Constrain the sketch centrepoint to the origin (select both points and hit 'c' for coincident)

This time, when you create the pad feature, make it **10mm**, and reverse the direction so that the solid is below the origin:

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/FootPadReversed.png)

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/FootComplete.png)

When we attach the top of the foot to the bottom of the leg, we can use the origin without needing to add another Local Co-ordinate System.

Save the *Foot* file.

------------------------

Create the leg and foot assembly:
=====================

To enable file model names to appear in the assembly windows, close all the files and re-open them.

For the LegFootAssembly, add a Model ![](TableSubassyScreenshots/Assy4Model.png).  We don't need a Body in the assembly as we did in the *Leg* and *Foot* (though it won't do any harm).

Select the *LegFootAssembly* tab (at the bottom of the window)

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/LegFootAssemblyTab.png)

to activate the file.

Create a new Assembly 4 model. ![](TableSubassyScreenshots/Assy4Model.png)

From the Assembly 4 workbench toolbar, select "*Insert part into the assembly*".  ![](TableSubassyScreenshots/InsertPartAssembly.png)

Choose **Leg#Body** and click OK.

Repeat for the foot, choosing **Foot#Body**.

Because we chose the pad direction for the leg to be **up** from the origin, and the pad direction for the foot to be **down**, the parts automatically align correctly, each with its origin at the assembly origin:

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/FootLegAssy.png)

Save the *LegFootAssembly* file.

-------------------------

Create the table assembly:
============================

Activate the *TableAssembly* file: ![](TableSubassyScreenshots/TableAssyTab.png)

Add a model ![](TableSubassyScreenshots/Assy4Model.png) only.  As with the foot assembly, a Body is not required.

Insert the *TableTop* part into the assembly
-------------

From the Assembly 4 workbench toolbar, select *Insert part into the assembly*.  ![](TableSubassyScreenshots/InsertPartAssembly.png)

Select **TableTop#Body** and hit OK.
This will insert the *TableTop* part at the origin.

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/AssemblyTop.png)

Insert the *LegFootAssembly*
-------------

Insert ![](TableSubassyScreenshots/InsertPartAssembly.png) the leg and foot assembly in the same way by choosing **LegFootAssembly#Model**.

This also inserts the assembly by default at the origin:

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/AssemblyLegFootInitial.png)



We need to attach it to the corner of the table.  For this, we need to create **Local Co-ordinate Systems** (LCS), four on the *TableTop* and a matching one on the *LegFootAssembly*.

**Create the *TableTop* LCSs:**

Open the *TableTop* file, select the **Body** in the tree and click "Create new co-ordinate system in part." ![](TableSubassyScreenshots/CreateCoordinateSystem.png) from the Assembly 4 workbench.

Rename it to "LCS\_Leg1"

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/LCS_Leg1.png)

This will place our new LCS at the origin:

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/LCS_Leg1Origin.png)

Move it to the corner where we want to attach the leg as follows:

Right-click on the LCS in the model tree:

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/LCS_Leg1ModelTree.png)

Select "Edit Datum" to bring up the Co-ordinate system parameters dialog.

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/LCSCoordinateSystmemParameters.png)

In the order shown by 1,2 and 3 below, select the **vertices** at the bottom corners of the table top:

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/LCSCoordinateSystemMove1.png)

Next, select the Attachment mode "**Align O-X-Y**" to indicate that the three points we just selected should be the Origin, X-axis direction and Y-axis direction of our new LCS.

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/LCSAlignO-X-Y.png)

This will align the new LCS as shown:

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/LCSAligned.png)

**\*Note:** If you have a high-res screen, it may be easier to select the vertices if you increase the pick radius:
*Edit -> Preferences -> Display -> 3D View -> Pick radius*

Add LCS\_Leg2, LCS\_Leg3 and LCS\_Leg4 in the same way, rotating the table top each time.

**\*Note:** Ensure you select three **vertices** each time for your Origin, X-direction and Y-direction, and not one of the other LCSs you just created.

Our part should now look like this:

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/LCSAlignedComplete.png)

Also check that your LCSs are created at the root of the Body tree as shown:

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/TreeLCSRoot.png)

If you want to import an LCS into another assembly later, it must be at the root level.

**Create the LegFootAssembly LCS:**

It is not possible to position an LCS in an assembly, so we instead create an LCS in the *Leg* part and **import** it into the *LegFootAssembly*.

Activate the *Leg* part: ![](TableSubassyScreenshots/TabLeg.png)

Click Create new co-ordinate system in part. ![](TableSubassyScreenshots/CreateCoordinateSystem.png)

Rename it to "LCS\_TopCorner".
This will place it at the origin as shown:

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/LCSTopCornerDefault.png)

Right click on the new LCS in the model tree:

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/LCS_TopCornerRightClick.png)

and select "Edit datum".

As before with the *TableTop*, select the three corners and choose attachment mode **O-X-Y**.  This time, choose the corners at the **top** of the leg, so that the top of the *Leg* will attach to the bottom of the *TableTop*.

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/LCS_LegOXY.png)

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/LCSLegChooseOXY.png)

Hit OK and save the *Leg* file.

Activate the *LegFootAssembly* file, where you will now see the new LCS.

Select the new LCS in the model tree of the *LegFootAssembly*:


![](TableSubassyScreenshots/LCS_LegFootSelected.png)


Click "Import datum object" ![](TableSubassyScreenshots/ImportDatumObject.png) and keep the default settings:

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/ImportDatumObjectDefaults.png)

We can now see a copy of the datum object in the *LegFootAssembly* tree:

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/TreeLegFootAssyImportedDatum.png)


Activate the *TabelAssembly* file: ![](TableSubassyScreenshots/TableAssyTab.png)

Select the LegFootAssembly in the model tree:

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/TreeSelectLegFootAssembly.png)

Click "Move/Attach a part in the assembly" ![](TableSubassyScreenshots/MoveAttachPart.png)

In the following dialog, select Attach to: TableTop.
Under "Select LCS in Part:" choose LCS\_TopCorner.
Under "Select LSC in Parent:" choose LCS\_Leg1

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/AssemblyTablePlaceLinkedPart.png)

This aligns the two parts by aligning the co-ordinate systems we created.

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/AssemblyTableLeg1.png)

Hit OK, and then repeat for the other three legs, renaming them as you go to LegFootAssembly_2, etc.

The finished product won't win us any Furniture Industry Association awards, but at least we can now make assemblies and sub-assembles with Zolko's Assembly 4 workbench.

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/AssemblyTableComplete.png)

Summary
===============
We need a total of nine parts to assemble the table: four legs, four feet and a table top.  We could add each of these nine individually, but it is much faster - and easier to update - if we include the leg and foot together as a sub-assembly.

To do this, we need to add a Local Co-ordinate System to the leg, and import it into the leg/foot subassembly for use in the finished product.

Bonus exercise:
=================

Now that we have used the LCS in the *LegFootAssembly* to position the parts on the *TableTop*, moving them is very simple:

Activate the *Leg* file.

Right-click on LCS\_TopCorner and select "Edit datum":

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/LCS_TopCornerRightClick.png)

Move the LCS out from the Body with an offset of -10mm in the X and Y directions:

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/AttachmentOffset.png)

Click OK.

As this is the point that is attached to the *TableTop*, the legs will move inwards.

Activate the *TableAssembly* file and click the "Update Assembly" ![](TableSubassyScreenshots/UpdateAssembly.png) button on the Assembly 4 workbench toolbar.

The four legs now move in under the table slightly as shown.

![](TableSubassyScreenshots/AssemblyTableCompleteBonus.png)

We can adjust LCS positions by rotating or translating on any axis as needed, making this a good modular design.
